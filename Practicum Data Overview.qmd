```

## Data Import

Getting started, we'll begin by importing the dataset.

The data is stored in .xlsx format with two sheets. The first being in wide format (primary) and the second being in long format (medical history).

We'll use the readxl package to import both sheets separately:

```{r}

# Define the file path
file_path <- "C:\\Users\\domin\\Downloads\\nesDataPull_2-14-2025.xlsx"

# Read the first sheet
patient_info <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = 1)  # By index

# Read the second sheet
MedHx <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = 2)  # By index


```

Let's do a quick overview to check our import was successful

```{r}
head(patient_info)

head(MedHx)
```

## Comorbidities Formatting:

Everything looks good. However, I want one contiguous database with all of the data.

MedHx is in the long format. In this case, it's in the long format. I'll need to switch it to the wide format based on the variable: tblPatient::EXT_ID

```{r}

# We'll start by flipping the data to have each patient ID number as the observation. To do this, let's change the ID variable name into something easier.

MedHx$patient_id <- MedHx$`tblPatient::EXT_ID`

# Now get rid of the old name:

MedHx <- MedHx %>% select(-`tblPatient::EXT_ID`)


MedHx_Wide <- pivot_wider(MedHx, id_cols = patient_id, names_from = condition, values_from = -c(patient_id,condition, diagnosisClass))

head(MedHx_Wide)

```

### Data Concatenation:

Great, but we still have over 1,100 comorbidities. This isn't helpful, let's focus on some of the main ones and make a reduced dataframe:

Currently, we have many different variables that are measuring similar constructs. Let's break this down for Psych Disorders:

-   Depression:

    -   Major depressive disorder

    -   Depression

    -   Major depressive disorder (MDD)

    -   depression

    -   Unspecified depressive disorder

    -   major depressive disorder (MDD)

    -   situational depression

    -   Major Depressive disorder (MDD)

    -   Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder (HC CODE)

    -   Post Partum Depression

-   Anxiety

    -   Anxiety

    -   Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)

    -   anxiety

    -   Generalized anxiety disorder

    -   Anxiety symptoms

    -   Anxiety disorder

    -   Occasional Anxiety

    -   Social anxiety disorder

    -   illness anxiety disorder

    -   seizure anxiety

    -   anxiety disorder

    -   generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)

    -   Anxiety Disorder

    -   Illness anxiety Disorder

-   PTSD

    -   PTSD

    -   Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

    -   Trauma and stress related disorder

    -   Post Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

    -   complex PTSD

    -   post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

    -   trauma and stress related disorder

    -   C-PTSD

    -   Trauma

-   Bipolar

    -   bipolar 1 disorder

    -   Bipolar Disorder

    -   Bipolar Disorder 1

    -   Bipolar (type II)

    -   Bipolar 1 disorder

    -   Bipolar disorder

    -   Bipolar II disorder

    -   Bipolar Disorder II

    -   Bipolar I Disorder

    -   bipolar 2 disorder

    -   bipolar type I

-   Borderline PD

    -   borderline personality disorder

    -   Borderline Personality Disorder

    -   borderline and prominent dissociation

    -   Borderline personality disorder

    -   Borderline personality Disorder

We will need to combine these variables into groups for further analysis:

```{r}

# Let's start with Psych

# This chunk creates the MedHx_Psych_Full dataframe by using information from the MedHx_Wide dataframe. I want our new dataframe to only contain variables that have the words in quotes in their variable names. 

MedHx_Psych_Full <- MedHx_Wide %>%         
  select(patient_id, matches("depress|anxiety|PTSD|Borderline|Bipolar|Trauma|Personality", ignore.case = TRUE)) 

head(MedHx_Psych_Full)
```

### Dummy Coding Comorbidities.

Great, the data is flipped to wide, now we want it to be made to be 1s and 0s for dummy coding. Currently, the data is either coded as a string (1), or NULL. All variables are currently a list (except for ID), I want to convert them to double while maintaining their binary status.

```{r}

# We will mutate across all variables and make them 1 or zero. If the list contained a 1, then it will stay a 1, if the values were anything else, it will be 0. 

MedHx_Psych_Full <- MedHx_Psych_Full %>%
    mutate(across(where(is.list), ~ as.numeric(ifelse(lengths(.) > 0 & !sapply(., is.null), 1, 0))))

head(MedHx_Psych_Full)
```

#### General dummy codes

Now, that we have this complete list of binary codes, I also want to have dummy codes for broad levels of mental health comorbidities. This will be helpful, as many of our variables have differences in spelling or capitalization. This will create a coding system to capture all variables that fall under a general umbrella (i.e. depression, anxiety, etc).

```{r}

# Let's create a global dummy variable for depression: This chunk will go row-by-row in the MedHx_Psych_Full dataframe. The mutate function will create a new variable called 'depression_any'. This new variable will be populated with a 1 if any of the following binary disorder variable are coded as a 1. If non of these disorders are coded as a 1, then 'depression_any' will be coded as a 0.

MedHx_Psych_Full <- MedHx_Psych_Full %>%
  rowwise() %>%
   mutate(depression_any = as.numeric(any(c_across(c(`Major depressive disorder`, Depression, `Major depressive disorder (MDD)`, depression, `Unspecified depressive disorder`, `major depressive disorder (MDD)`, `situational depression`, `Major Depressive disorder (MDD)`, `Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder (HC CODE)`, `Post Partum Depression`)) == 1))) %>%
  ungroup()

# Same thing for Anxiety:
MedHx_Psych_Full <- MedHx_Psych_Full %>%
  rowwise() %>%
   mutate(anxiety_any = as.numeric(any(c_across(c(Anxiety, `Generalized anxiety disorder`, anxiety, `Generalized anxiety disorder`, `Anxiety symptoms`, `Anxiety disorder`, `Occasional Anxiety`, `Social anxiety disorder`, `illness anxiety disorder`, `seizure anxiety`, `anxiety disorder`, `generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)`, `Anxiety Disorder`, `Illness anxiety Disorder`, `Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)`)) == 1))) %>%
  ungroup()

# Same thing for PTSD
MedHx_Psych_Full <- MedHx_Psych_Full %>%
  rowwise() %>%
   mutate(ptsd_any = as.numeric(any(c_across(c(PTSD, `Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)`, `Trauma and stress related disorder`, `Post Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)`, `complex PTSD`, `post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)`, `trauma and stress related disorder`, `C-PTSD`, Trauma)) == 1))) %>%
  ungroup()

# Same thing for Bipolar
MedHx_Psych_Full <- MedHx_Psych_Full %>%
  rowwise() %>%
   mutate(bipolar_any = as.numeric(any(c_across(c(`bipolar 1 disorder`, `Bipolar Disorder`, `Bipolar Disorder 1`, `Bipolar (type II)`, `Bipolar 1 disorder`, `Bipolar disorder`, `Bipolar II disorder`, `Bipolar Disorder II`, `Bipolar I Disorder`, `bipolar 2 disorder`, `bipolar type I`)) == 1))) %>%
  ungroup()

# Same thing for Borderline
MedHx_Psych_Full <- MedHx_Psych_Full %>%
  rowwise() %>%
   mutate(borderline_any = as.numeric(any(c_across(c(`borderline personality disorder`, `Borderline Personality Disorder`, `borderline and prominent dissociation`, `Borderline personaliy disorder`, `Borderline personality Disorder`)) == 1))) %>%
  ungroup()

# Lastly, I also want a combined personality disorder dummy as well
MedHx_Psych_Full <- MedHx_Psych_Full %>%
  rowwise() %>%
   mutate(pd_any = as.numeric(any(c_across(c(`Personality disorder`, `Obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD)`, `schizoid personality`, `avoidant personality disorder`, `Antisocial Personality Disorder`, `Personality Disorder`)) == 1))) %>%
  ungroup()

```

### Further Reductions:

Now that we've concatenated some of the data for some of the most common comorbidities, I want to get rid of the previously mentioned variables (i.e. variables assessing the same thing but typed slightly different). This will create a cleaner database that is easier to merge with the primary patient dataframe.

```{r}

# Let's just select the variables that we want to keep in our dataset:

MedHx_Psych <- MedHx_Psych_Full %>% select(patient_id, `Obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD)`, `schizoid personality`, `avoidant personality disorder`, `Antisocial Personality Disorder`, depression_any, anxiety_any, ptsd_any, bipolar_any, borderline_any, pd_any)

```

### Comorbidites Appendix:

Great, data cleaning for comorbidities is complete. As of 2/17/2025, we have only cleaned mental health comorbidities. If you are interested in any other form of comorbidities, you can select whatever diagnosis you would want and follow along from "Data Concatenation" tab.

![](images/clipboard-3083755900.png)

Please use this code chunk to add in whatever comorbidity you may be interested in by adding a '\|' after the last value but within the quotes. I also suggest changing 'MedHx_Psych_Full to another name. This will pull any variable into the newly created dataset which is named whatever you like. Please do not change the code for what exists. Only add new things in by copying, pasting, and editing the newly pasted code.

Note: Please notice how the first value is 'depress' rather than 'depression'. When looking through the variables, some diagnoses were labeled as 'depression' and some were labeled as 'depressive symptoms'. If I put 'Depression' in the quotes, it would not capture the 'depressive symptoms' variable. If this is the case for your variable of interest, I suggest using only as many characters as needed rather than spelling it out verbatim.

Once you have done this, continue this trend by using the subsequent code to filter out anything you want. This can be done by copying the existing code, pasting, and then altering the name of the dataframes called in the code chunk to match your given dataframe name. E.g. alter any point that says MedHx_Psych_Full to {insert_your_data_name_here}. Control-F is your friend for this.

# Data Overview:

## General Overview:

I want to get a basic sense of what this dataframe looks like from a demographics standpoint:

```{r}

# Let's look at the overall distribution:
describe(patient_info)

prop.table(table(patient_info$`tblPatient::Gender`))
prop.table(table(patient_info$`tblPatient::Race`))
prop.table(table(patient_info$c_insuranceAtBaseline))



```

That is helpful, but I also want to visualize some confusing elements. Specifically, I want visualize the distribution of insurance types and race:

```{r}

# Let's start with insurance

plot1 <- ggplot(patient_info, aes(x = c_insuranceAtBaseline)) +
            geom_bar() +
            theme_minimal() +
            labs(title = "Insurance Distributions", x = "Insurance Plans", y = "Count")
            theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))  
ggplotly(plot1)   # Convert to interactive plotly chart


# Let's do the same thing for race:
plot2 <- ggplot(patient_info, aes(x = `tblPatient::Race`)) +
            geom_bar() +
            theme_minimal() +
            labs(title = "Race Distribution", x = "Race", y = "Count")
            theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))  
ggplotly(plot2)   # Convert to interactive plotly chart
```

We are looking at:

-   A total of 1008 patients

-   A mean age of 39.5

-   74.4% female, 21.7% male, and .04% other

-   75.8% White

-   A large group coming from Colorado Health First, United, Cigna, Anthem, and United.

```         
-   The largest Cohort is Colorado Health First. This is effectively medicaid, and could be a good marker for SES.
```

## Preliminary Results:

Data entry has been spotty throughout both sheets. The primary issue is data entry points that are similar, but not fully the same. As a result, we're seeing a misleading spread of many different data points that are actually quite similar but are not captured as one value.

Before any actual analysis can be done, we'll need to do some intensive data cleaning to make any conclusions about this data.

# In My Data Cleaning Era

## Insurance

Let's start with the most egregious offender: Insurance:

What we'll need to do is

```{r}

# First, let's look at all the possible values of insurance before we concatenate

unique(patient_info$c_insuranceAtBaseline)
```

That is quite a lot: Let's begin by combining values:

This totals to 117 patients being insured normally and 58 patients in the Other category

### Dummy variables:

Now that we know which variables go where, we'll need to create a dummy variable to hold these values. For our purposes, we will create a categorical variable with 7 levels. 6 of these levels will hold the categories we described in the previous section, and the 7th will be for the 'Other' Category.

```{r}

# To create a specific variable, I'm going to use the stringr packages to create a new categorical variable based on these results. The str_detect function takes the original variable, that registers the patterns in the string given in quotes, and markes the new variable 'insurance' as having a category named after the '~'.

# Wall of code incoming:


patient_info <- patient_info %>%
  mutate(insurance = case_when(
    grepl("Medicaid|Medicaid Health First|Medicaid/Medicaid health first|Colorado Access Medicaid/CO Access BH|Colorado Health First|Medicaid Health First|Out of state Medicaid|Colorado Medicaid/Medicaid Colorado Health First|Rocky Mountain Health Plan Medicaid|Denver Health Medicaid|Medicaid Colorado Health First RAE 2|CO Health First|Colorado Community Health Alliance|Colorado Medicaid Health First RAE5|Colorado Medicaid RAE 3|rae 3|Colorado Medicaid|Health Colorado- RAE 4|Medicaid - Colorado Community Health Alliance|Medicaid RAE 3|Texas Medicaid|Out of State Medicaid|Health Colorado, Inc.|Health First|Colorado Access|Health first|COLORADO HEALTH FIRST|CHF Community Health Alliance|CHA|Colorado Medicaid CCHA|Colorado health first|RAE 5|RAE 2|RAE 3|rae 5|UNLISTED MC|DENVER HEALTH MEDICAID|MEDICAID COLORADO HEALTH FIRST|RAE 4|comm Health|Comm Health Alliance|MMHP United Medicaid|Colorado Health First - RAE3|CO CHA|CHF Community Alliance|CHF RAE 3|comm health alli|CHF Region 5|CHF region 3|CHF RAE Region 3|Comm Health Alli|CCHA|Community Health Alliance|ER Health First|WY Medicaid|ROCKY MOUNTAIN HEALTH PLAN MC", c_insuranceAtBaseline, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Medicaid/CHF",

    TRUE ~ "Other"  # Default category for everything else
  ))
```

Great, now let's plot this again to see if it looks cleaner:

```{r}
plot1 <- ggplot(patient_info, aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(insurance)), fill = insurance)) +
            geom_bar() +
            scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
            theme_minimal() +
            labs(title = "Insurance Distributions", x = "Insurance Plans", y = "Count") + 
            theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))  
ggplotly(plot1)   # Convert to interactive plotly chart
```
